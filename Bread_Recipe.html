		<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>Add one teaspoon of sugar and package of yeast to warm water and let sit for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
			<p>In medium mixing bowl combine flour, salt and remainder of sugar.</p>
			<p>Add water to flour mixture and stir until it forms a ball.  Take out of the bowl and knead for about 1 minute.</p>
			<p>Return to mixing bowl and allow to rise for 1-2 hours.  Dough will double or triple in size.</p>
			<p>Preheat oven to 405 F.</p>
			<p>Take out of bowl and knead again for a minute or two.  Cut dough ball into 3 equal parts.  Fold equal parts into balls for about a minute each and place on greased baking sheet.  Allow to rise for 10 minutes.</p>
			<p>Gently score the tops of your loafs 5-6 times to allow for expansion while baking.  Baste the top of the loaf with oil and sprinkle a pinch of kosher salt on the top of the loaf.</p>
			<p>Bake for 21 minutes.  Let cool for 5 minutes.  Slice and enjoy.</p>
